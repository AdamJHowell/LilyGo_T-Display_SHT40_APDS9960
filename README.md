# LilyGo_T-Display_SHT40_APDS9960

This app will read temperature and humidity data from a SHT40 sensor, and read illumination data from a APDS9960 sensor.

It will eventually display this information on the in-built TFT screen.

The SHT40 and APDS9960 devices are connected via the STEMMA QT port (SDA on GPIO 43, SCL on GPIO 44) near the USB-C connector.
